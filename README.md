## Description

- Party system (lobbies, queues, and shared party flow).
- Store-ready menu integration and vote menus.
- Victory effects and end-game celebrations.
- Scoreboards, timers, and game lifecycle management.
- Player stats tracking and placeholders.
- XP system, leaderboards, and achievements.
- Arena management tools and setup commands.

## Features
- Pattern system for color sequences.
- Flexible timing controls for music and search phases.
- Floor region setup with the magic stick tool.

## Arena setup
### Common steps
Use these steps to register the arena and attach the module:

- `/baa create [id] <standalone|party>` — Create a new arena in standalone or party mode.
- `/baa arena [id] setname [name]` — Give the arena a friendly display name.
- `/baa arena [id] setlobby` — Set the lobby spawn for the arena.
- `/baa arena [id] minplayers [amount]` — Define the minimum players required to start.
- `/baa arena [id] maxplayers [amount]` — Define the maximum players allowed.
- `/baa game [arena_id] add [minigame]` — Attach this minigame module to the arena.
- `/baa stick` — Get the setup tool to select regions.
- `/baa game [arena_id] [minigame] bounds set` — Save the game bounds for this arena.
- `/baa game [arena_id] [minigame] spawn add` — Add spawn points for players.
- `/baa game [arena_id] [minigame] time [minutes]` — Set the match duration.

### Module-specific steps
Finish the setup with the commands below:
- `/baa game [arena_id] block_party floor set` — Select and save the floor area.
- `/baa game [arena_id] block_party pattern add <name>` — Create a new color pattern.
- `/baa game [arena_id] block_party pattern remove <name>` — Remove a pattern.
- `/baa game [arena_id] block_party pattern list` — List existing patterns.
- `/baa game [arena_id] block_party pattern initial <name>` — Set the initial pattern.
- `/baa game [arena_id] block_party musictime <seconds>` — Set the music phase length (optional).
- `/baa game [arena_id] block_party searchtime <seconds>` — Set the time to find the color (optional).
- `/baa game [arena_id] block_party decreasetime <seconds>` — Decrease the search time per round (optional).
- `/baa game [arena_id] block_party mintime <seconds>` — Set the minimum search time (optional).

### Procedural patterns (Minecraft)
The Minecraft edition can generate a fresh floor pattern for every round. Existing arenas remain in static mode
until procedural patterns are explicitly enabled.

- `/baa game [arena_id] block_party procedural on` — Enable runtime-generated patterns.
- `/baa game [arena_id] block_party procedural off` — Return to saved patterns.
- `/baa game [arena_id] block_party procedural status` — Show the arena's current mode and template list.
- `/baa game [arena_id] block_party procedural templates all` — Enable every built-in template.
- `/baa game [arena_id] block_party procedural templates <type...>` — Restrict generation to selected templates.

Available templates: `stripes`, `diagonal`, `rainbow`, `checker`, `rings`, `sectors`, `islands`, `waves`,
`spiral`, `creeper`, and `mosaic`.

Pattern size and color count scale with the round number. Their defaults are configured under
`procedural_patterns` in the module's `settings.yml`. Procedural arenas only require floor bounds; saved patterns
remain optional and are not modified or removed.
